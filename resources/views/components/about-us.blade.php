                Mechatronics engineers create and improve automated processes. If superiors  approve their project, mechatronics engineers may then use computer-aided  design software to develop and test potential solutions. Design, develop, maintain and manage high technology engineering systems for the automation of industrial tasks. Apply mechatronic or automated solutions to the transfer of material, components or finished goods. Apply advanced control systems, which are usually computer-driven.
